### SOLID Design Principles
Based on:
* **Creational:** Builder, Singleton, Prototype.
* **Structural:** Adapter, Decorator Bridge.
* **Behavioral:** Template, State, Observer.


Principles are:
* **Single Responsability:** A class should have only one reason to change.
* **Open-Close:** Classes should be open for extention but closed for modification.
* **Liskov Substitution:** Should be able to substitute a base type for subtype.
* **Interface Segregation:** Split Interfaces and don't overload.
* **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules should not depend low-level ones, use abstraction.
