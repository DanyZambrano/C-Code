## Code Quality

> Code quality is a generic term that refers to code clarity, reliability, maintainability, and extensibility. It applies to code and programmers in any language, but there are specific aspects of C++ that are worthy of specific mention.

> Code quality should not be too time-consuming, and ideally, it should not be a dedicated task. Rather, the quality of one’s code should be considered throughout development and improved when opportunities present themselves. The point is that code quality can be improved after the fact but, most importantly, it should also be considered with best practices in place during every stage of development.

## Technical debt
Technical debt is the term used to describe the cost of reworking a solution in the future, specifically because a simpler approach was chosen to save time at an earlier stage. Choosing a better solution takes longer during the original implementation, but results in less technical debt.

## Refactoring

Code refactoring is the process of making changes to code to make it more efficient, readable, maintainable, and extensible, all without changing its basic functionality. Sometimes it’s as simple as wrapping a set of variables into a new class to make that code more concise and encapsulated; other times it might be a complex process that involves large parts of your codebase, especially when a refactor is needed for the addition of new functionality.

## Code Reviews

A code review is a process in which fellow developers systematically check each others’ code. This can be done by people in a supervisory role or by peers of the same level.

The goals of a code review include validating the program design, ensuring that all of the features have been implemented, and enforcing best practices that include coding style and convention. For instance, code reviews will help to identify areas that can be optimized, such as making the code more generic, using templates, improving an algorithm, or introducing a certain software pattern.
